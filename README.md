Welcome to 3voScript!
==================

Thanks for viewing this Script! But there are some rules that should not be ignored:

- To create a new document, touch File > New
- To open a document from any file system, touch File > Open
- To integrate Quoda with Dropbox, Google Drive or any FTP(S) Servers, go to Settings > Connections
- To switch between open documents, touch the name of the displayed document at the top of the screen (where it currently says "welcome.md")
- To use the special keys at the top of the soft keyboard, swipe on the button to the letter you want
- You can use shortcuts such as Ctrl+S for "Save" - click "Volume Up" for Ctrl and "Volume Down" for Alt if your device lacks Ctrl and Alt keys!
- Don't like the syntax highlighting theme or font? Go to Settings > Appearance

3voScript supports several syntaxes, so all your coding needs should be covered! There are so many other features in Quoda, so be sure to check them all out over at our website:
